# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using patient health data. I trained and evaluated three classification models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest — to identify the most accurate approach.

Key highlights:

Performed data preprocessing and feature preparation on structured health data

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation

Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices

Found Logistic Regression to achieve the highest accuracy while being interpretable

Visualized results and model performance for clear insights

Skills & Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
